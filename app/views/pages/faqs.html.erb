              JobBunny is a network that enables individuals to build their own businesses and make meaningful income. Taskers are independent contractors and manage their accounts according to their preferences.

  The number one thing we offer Taskers is flexibility. JobBunny gives you the flexibility to choose when you work, the categories in which you work, where you work, and how much you charge.

                 <div class="cd-faq-content">
                   Hiring a Tasker only requires a valid credit card. You will not be charged until after the task is completed. You can book a Tasker up to 15 days in advance using the web app.

 In some of our active metros, you can book a Tasker for Same Day help.

                 <div class="cd-faq-content">
                   When you book a task, you choose which Tasker you hire, and can see their skills, reviews and hourly rates.

 The hourly rate is inclusive of the payment for your Tasker and the 15% JobBunny service fee. Your Tasker sees the price that Clients pay, as well as the exact hourly rate they will earn.

 For example, if you pay $100, $85 goes to your Tasker. The JobBunny service fee is 15% of the total price you pay for the task, excluding any reimbursements made to the Tasker (Taskers receive 100% of any reimbursements).
